# README-Generator
This application can be used to generate a README.md by answering a set of prompts.

## Description
This project takes a base starter code and builds a console command line application to generate README.md files automatically based on user responses to a series of prompts. It includes options for what sections to include, different types of badges you'd like to add, what license you'd like to use, and a range of text input fields for adding content to the document.

## Usage
To use this application, begin by opening a command console in the root directory. Initialize the program with the command 'node index.js' and it will begin the first prompt. For the text field prompts, simply type the text that you would like to appear in that section of the README and press enter to move on to the next prompt. For the checkbox and list prompts, follow the on-screen directions. Any field you have chosen not to include in your document, simply skip by pressing enter without typing anything. Once you have finished all the prompts, the new README.md will be generated automatically.

## Features
The list choice of which license link and badge to display is implemented using a switch statement that takes in the choice as input and has cases for every license available on github.
